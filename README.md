# Distributed-Computing-2019
This repository features the code and documentation used in the design and development of my Distributed Computing project from 2019.

The task of this project was to design and develop a UDP based Client/Server File Transfer
System, which enables users to login and logout of the system, and to upload and download
files to the server. For this project, the flow of data was outlined as a beginning. The
flow of data in the case of this project refers to the directions messages travel between the
Server and Client and what these messages mean. As aforementioned, Login, Logout,
Upload and Download are all interactions the Client will make with the Server.
